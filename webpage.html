    <p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a
        German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists
        of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to
        quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding
        of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][5] His mass–energy
        equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous
        equation".[6] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and
        especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[7] a pivotal step in the development of
        quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] In a 1999 poll of
        130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest
        physicist of all time.[10] His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly
        synonymous with genius.[11]

        Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject
        of the Kingdom of Württemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the
        mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating
        in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1903, he secured a
        permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to
        the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the
        Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also
        became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] In 1933, while he was
        visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi "war of extermination"
        against his fellow Jews,[12] Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in
        1940.[13] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to
        the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein
        supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.[14]

        In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four
        groundbreaking papers.[15] These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion,
        introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to
        account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated that if the special theory
        is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity
        that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the
        following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution
        of the universe as a whole.[16][17] The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to
        statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation,
        in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.

        For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately
        unsuccessful. Firstly, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into
        science's picture of the world, objecting that "God does not play dice".[18] Secondly, he attempted to devise a
        unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too. As a
        result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics</p>

    <p>Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[19] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March
        1879.[20][21] His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline
        Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and
        his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical
        equipment based on direct current.[19]

        Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he was
        transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium [de]) where he received
        advanced primary and then secondary school education.[22]

        In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without
        success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to
        the more efficient, alternating current alternative.[23] The failure of their bid forced them to sell their
        Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan
        and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani.[24] Einstein, then fifteen, stayed
        behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he
        was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote
        that the school's policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a
        letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family
        in Pavia.[25] While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the
        Ether in a Magnetic Field".[26][27]

        Einstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise
        normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and
        Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the
        Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday.[28][29][30] A family tutor, Max Talmud, said that only a
        short time after he had given the twelve year old Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy "had worked through the
        whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius
        was so high I could not follow."[31] Einstein recorded that he had "mastered integral and differential calculus"
        while still just fourteen.[29] His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already
        confident that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".[31]

        <p>In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert
            Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd,
            along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to
            alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to
            warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."[150][151] To make certain the US
            was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd
            and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he
            had never considered.[152] He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President
            Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.</p>

        <p>In 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a
            liberal party.[165][166] Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical
            of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as "Why Socialism?".[167][168] His opinions on the
            Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a "well-regulated system of
            government" and called their rule a "regime of terror and a tragedy in human history". He later adopted a
            more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on
            Vladimir Lenin:</p>

        <p>On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic
            aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[203] He took the draft
            of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh
            anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.[204]

            Einstein refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I
            have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."[205] He died in the Princeton Hospital early
            the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.[206]

            During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without
            the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what
            made Einstein so intelligent.[207] Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey,[208] and his
            ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.[209][210]

            In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert
            Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: "He was almost wholly without sophistication
            and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and
            profoundly stubborn."[211]

            Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of
            Jerusalem in Israel.[</p>
